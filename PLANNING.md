# Planning Document: Claude Code Advanced Patterns

## Scenario Choice and Justification

**Chosen Scenario**: Claude Code Agents and Hooks - Advanced Integration Patterns

**Why I Chose This Scenario**: I selected this scenario because it directly aligns with my day-to-day work using Claude Code for complex development tasks. Through practical experience, I've discovered that the gap between basic Claude Code usage and advanced workflow optimization is significant, and developers need concrete patterns they can immediately apply. This scenario allows me to implement the EPCC (Explore-Plan-Code-Commit) workflow described as a best practice in [Anthropic Engineering's blog post](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices), demonstrating how advanced Claude Code techniques can transform development workflows from ad-hoc assistance to systematic, production-ready processes.

Additionally, this scenario dovetails perfectly with my [Claude Code CLI Setup](https://github.com/jawhnycooke/claude-code-cli-setup) project, which automates the deployment of Claude Code agents, commands, and hooks. While this repository provides the comprehensive pattern library and documentation (the "what" and "why"), the CLI setup tool provides the automation layer (the "how to deploy quickly"). Together, these projects form a complete ecosystem where developers can both understand advanced patterns through detailed documentation and rapidly deploy them to their projects with a single command. This synergy enables teams to go from learning to implementation in minutes rather than hours, making advanced Claude Code techniques accessible to developers at all skill levels.

## Documentation Strategy Outline

### 1. Success Criteria

I will know I've created truly helpful content when:

- **Immediate Applicability**: Developers can copy and use components within minutes, not hours
- **Measurable Impact**: Users report 50%+ reduction in repetitive tasks and code review time
- **Pattern Recognition**: Developers understand not just "how" but "why" to use each pattern
- **Scalability**: Solutions work for both individual developers and enterprise teams
- **Community Adoption**: Patterns become referenced and extended by the community
- **Error Reduction**: Systematic approaches prevent common mistakes before they occur

**Key Success Metrics**:
- Time from discovery to first successful implementation: < 30 minutes
- Coverage of top 10 developer pain points with Claude Code
- Reduction in Claude Code token usage through optimization: 30%+
- Increase in development velocity: 40%+


### 2. Developer Needs Analysis

Based on research and experience, developers need:

#### **Knowledge Gaps to Address**
1. **Pattern Selection**: When to use agents vs hooks vs workflows
2. **Model Economics**: How to optimize Sonnet/Opus usage for cost efficiency
3. **Integration Points**: Where and how to connect Claude Code with existing tools
4. **Quality Assurance**: How to ensure AI-generated code meets production standards
5. **Team Collaboration**: Patterns for sharing and standardizing Claude Code usage

#### **Decision Framework Requirements**
Developers need clear guidance on:
- **Agent Selection**: Which agent for which task (security vs performance vs testing)
- **Hook Timing**: When to use pre-commit vs post-commit vs continuous monitoring
- **Workflow Complexity**: Simple commands vs multi-stage workflows
- **Tool Integration**: Native Claude Code vs MCP servers vs external tools
- **Error Handling**: Recovery patterns and fallback strategies

#### **Practical Needs**
- Working code they can copy and modify
- Real-world examples from actual projects
- Troubleshooting guides for common issues
- Performance benchmarks and optimization tips
- Security and compliance patterns

### 3. Content Structure Plan

#### **Hierarchical Organization**

```
Repository Root
├── Core Components (What)
│   ├── Agents - Specialized AI assistants
│   ├── Commands - Quick action triggers
│   ├── Hooks - Lifecycle automation
│   └── Workflows - Multi-stage orchestrations
├── Documentation (How)
│   ├── Quick Start - 5-minute setup
│   ├── Component Guides - Deep dives
│   ├── Integration Patterns - Connecting tools
│   └── Best Practices - Production patterns
├── Templates (Starting Points)
│   └── Project-specific configurations
└── Use Cases (Why)
    └── Real-world scenarios
```

#### **Rationale for Structure**
- **Component-First**: Developers think in terms of building blocks
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple examples → complex patterns
- **Task-Oriented**: Organized by what developers want to accomplish
- **Copy-Friendly**: Each component is self-contained and reusable
- **Git-Native**: Structure works with version control patterns

### 4. Implementation Approach
