# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a documentation project focused on creating advanced Claude Code agents and hooks documentation. The main deliverable is a comprehensive documentation package that covers custom agent creation, advanced hooks implementation, and patterns for building sophisticated AI-assisted development workflows.

## Project Structure

├── PRODUCT.md              # Project requirements and specifications
├── CLAUDE.md               # This file - Claude Code guidance
└── [future directories]    # Documentation, code samples, and implementation files to be created
```

## Project Goals

The repository is being developed to create:

1. **Documentation Guide**: Comprehensive documentation covering advanced Claude Code concepts, implementation patterns, and best practices
2. **Technical Implementation**: Working code samples, configuration files, and reference implementations demonstrating these concepts
3. **GitHub Repository**: A complete package with practical examples and demonstrations

## Development Approach

### Phase 1: Planning
- Create a documentation strategy outline
- Define success criteria for helpful developer content
- Analyze developer needs for advanced Claude Code workflows
- Plan content structure and technical demonstrations

### Phase 2: Documentation Development
- Main documentation guide covering:
  - Workflow overview and process patterns
  - Step-by-step implementation guides
  - Best practices for context management and prompting
  - Troubleshooting common issues
  - Measurement and optimization strategies
- Working technical implementation with:
  - Code samples for custom agents
  - Hook configuration examples
  - Reusable workflow patterns
  - Diagrams and visualizations as needed

## Key Areas of Focus

1. **Custom Agent Creation**: Building specialized agents for complex development scenarios
2. **Advanced Hooks**: Implementing hooks that power sophisticated workflows
3. **Workflow Optimization**: Bridging the gap between basic Claude Code usage and advanced optimization
4. **Enterprise Deployment**: Patterns and practices for scaling Claude Code in team environments

## Documentation Requirements

When creating documentation in this repository:

- Focus on experienced developers who need to implement advanced Claude Code workflows
- Include practical, working examples that can be directly applied
- Address real-world challenges and provide actionable solutions
- Create clear decision frameworks for choosing implementation approaches
- Ensure all code samples are tested and functional

## File Naming Conventions

- Documentation files: Use descriptive names with kebab-case (e.g., `custom-agents-guide.md`)
- Code samples: Group by feature/concept in appropriately named directories
- Configuration files: Use standard naming conventions for the tool/framework

## Quality Standards

- All documentation should be clear, concise, and technically accurate
- Code samples must be functional and follow best practices
- Include error handling and edge cases in examples
- Provide context for when to use (and not use) specific patterns

## Next Steps

1. Create the planning document outlining the documentation strategy
2. Set up the basic repository structure for documentation and code samples
3. Begin developing the main documentation guide
4. Implement working code examples and demonstrations
5. Create visualizations and diagrams to support complex concepts
