# Background

Claude Code represents a revolutionary approach to AI-assisted development, enabling
developers to delegate complex coding tasks directly from their terminal. While basic Claude
Code usage is documented, advanced workflow optimization and enterprise deployment
scenarios remain challenging areas where developers need comprehensive guidance.

## Claude Code Agents and Hooks - Advanced Integration Patterns
Claude Code's agents and hooks commands enable sophisticated development workflows that
go beyond basic code generation. This scenario focuses on building custom agents,
implementing advanced hooks, and creating reusable patterns for complex development
scenarios.

## task:
Create a comprehensive documentation package featuring practical, production-ready implementations
of custom Claude Code agents, hooks, workflows, and templates. This package will include working
code examples that developers can immediately adopt, covering real-world use cases such as:
- Security review and compliance automation
- Performance optimization workflows
- Test generation and quality assurance
- Incident response and debugging
- Documentation generation and maintenance
- CI/CD orchestration with safety checks

## Submission Requirements

### Submission Format

- Scenario and choice justification: Your chosen scenario, and 2-3 sentences explaining
why you chose your scenario and any relevant experience related to that scenario
- Planning document: Brief outline of your documentation strategy (see
Recommended Approach: Phase 1)
- Documentation package (see Documentation Package Requirements):
-- Main documentation: Comprehensive guide in your preferred format
-- GitHub repository: Working implementation with code samples,
configuration files, and technical demonstrations

## Documentation Package Requirements
Your documentation package should include two parts:
1. A comprehensive documentation guide that covers the advanced concepts,
implementation patterns, and best practices for your chosen scenario

2. A working technical implementation (code samples, configuration files, or reference
implementation) that demonstrates these concepts in action

The documentation should be structured to help experienced developers successfully
implement your chosen scenario in their development workflows. Key deliverables include:
- **Custom Agent Library**: 6+ production-ready agents with model optimization (sonnet/opus selection)
- **Hook Configuration Patterns**: 5+ advanced hook templates for quality gates and automation
- **Workflow Orchestration**: 5+ complete workflow examples (feature development, incident response, etc.)
- **Slash Command Templates**: 6+ custom commands for common developer tasks
- **MCP Integration Examples**: 5+ external tool integrations (GitHub, databases, monitoring)
- **CLAUDE.md Templates**: 5+ project-specific configuration templates
- **Model Selection Guide**: Best practices for choosing between sonnet (default) and opus models
- **Implementation Guides**: Step-by-step tutorials with working code
- **Best Practices**: Context management, prompting strategies, and optimization techniques
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and resolution approaches
- **Measurement Strategies**: How to evaluate effectiveness and optimize workflows

## Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: Planning
Write a brief outline of your documentation strategy for your chosen scenario. This outline
should include both what content you're creating, as well as why. Some things to consider:
- Success criteria: How will you know you've created truly helpful content for
developers working with advanced Claude Code workflows?
- Developer needs analysis: What does a developer need to know to make intelligent
decisions about implementing your scenario?
- Content structure: Plan and rationale for organizing your documentation and
technical materials
- Implementation approach: What technical demonstrations will best illustrate the
concepts?
- Workflow optimization: How will you address the gap between basic usage and
advanced optimization?

### Phase 2: Documentation Development
Create your comprehensive documentation package including:
- Main documentation guide in your preferred format
- GitHub repository with working implementation, code samples, and configuration
examples
- Include diagrams, workflow visualizations, screencasts, or process charts as appropriate
