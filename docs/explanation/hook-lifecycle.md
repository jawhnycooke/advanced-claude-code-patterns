# Understanding Hook Lifecycle

How Claude Code hooks work, when they execute, and why they're designed this way.

## What Are Hooks?

Hooks are user-defined shell commands that execute at specific points in Claude Code's lifecycle. They provide deterministic control over Claude Code's behavior, ensuring certain actions always happen rather than relying on the LLM to choose to run them.

## Why Hooks Exist

### The Problem Hooks Solve

Without hooks, developers face several challenges:

1. **Inconsistent Behavior**: The LLM might forget to run formatters or linters
2. **Manual Overhead**: Developers must remember to run quality checks
3. **Safety Concerns**: No automatic prevention of dangerous operations
4. **Compliance Issues**: Difficulty tracking all tool usage for auditing

### The Hook Solution

Hooks address these issues by providing:

- **Automation**: Code formatting, linting, and testing happen automatically
- **Quality Control**: Enforce standards before any code changes
- **Safety**: Prevent modifications to sensitive files or dangerous commands
- **Consistency**: Uniform practices across all Claude Code sessions
- **Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of all tool usage

## Hook Execution Model

### Event-Driven Architecture

Claude Code uses an event-driven model where hooks respond to specific lifecycle events:

```
User Input → Claude Processing → Tool Execution → Response
     ↓              ↓                ↓             ↓
UserPromptSubmit → ... → PreToolUse → PostToolUse → Stop
```

### Synchronous Execution

Hooks execute synchronously, meaning:
- Claude Code waits for hook completion before continuing
- Hooks can block operations (especially with exit code 2)
- Multiple hooks for the same event run sequentially
- Hook execution time directly impacts Claude Code responsiveness

This synchronous model ensures deterministic behavior but requires hooks to be fast.

## Hook Types and Their Purpose

### PreToolUse Hooks
**Purpose**: Validation and prevention before tool execution

**Use Cases**:
- Validate file permissions before editing
- Check for coding standards violations
- Prevent dangerous commands (e.g., `rm -rf`)
- Log tool usage for compliance

**Blocking Capability**: Can prevent tool execution with exit code 2

### PostToolUse Hooks  
**Purpose**: Cleanup and follow-up actions after successful tool execution

**Use Cases**:
- Format code after editing
- Run tests after code changes
- Update documentation
- Commit changes to version control

**Blocking Capability**: Cannot block (tool already completed)

### Session Management Hooks
**Purpose**: Setup and teardown for Claude Code sessions

- **SessionStart**: Initialize project state, check dependencies
- **Stop**: Cleanup, final logging, status reports
- **PreCompact**: Save important context before compaction

### Agent Lifecycle Hooks
**Purpose**: Track and manage agent execution

- **SubagentStop**: Log agent completion, aggregate results
- **UserPromptSubmit**: Track user interactions, validate inputs

## Exit Code Philosophy

The exit code system provides nuanced communication between hooks and Claude Code:

### Exit Code 0: Success
"Everything is fine, continue as planned"
- Used for successful validations
- Informational logging that doesn't require action
- Warnings that don't need immediate attention

### Exit Code 1: Non-blocking Error
"Something's wrong, but Claude doesn't need to fix it"
- Configuration issues outside Claude's control
- External service failures
- Warnings that should be logged but not acted upon

### Exit Code 2: Blocking Error
"Stop what you're doing, Claude should fix this"
- Code formatting issues that can be automatically fixed
- Import sorting problems
- Linting errors with clear solutions
- Missing dependencies that can be installed

This design allows hooks to guide Claude's behavior intelligently.

## Hook Design Patterns

### Pattern 1: Validation Gates
Prevent actions that violate project standards:

```python
# Check if file should be modified
if file_path in PROTECTED_FILES:
    print(f"❌ Cannot modify protected file: {file_path}", file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(2)  # Block the operation
```

### Pattern 2: Automatic Correction
Fix issues automatically without user intervention:

```python
# Format code after editing
if file_path.endswith('.py'):
    subprocess.run(['black', file_path])
    subprocess.run(['isort', file_path])
```

### Pattern 3: Progressive Enhancement
Add capabilities without changing core workflow:

```python
# Add logging without affecting normal operation
try:
    log_tool_usage(tool_name, file_path)
except Exception:
    pass  # Don't break workflow for logging failures
```

## Security Model

### Execution Context
Hooks run with the same permissions as the Claude Code process:
- User-level file system access
- Network access (if available to user)
- Environment variable access
- Process creation abilities

### Security Boundaries
What hooks cannot do:
- Escalate privileges beyond user permissions
- Access files outside user permissions
- Modify Claude Code's internal state directly
- Intercept or modify LLM communications

### Trust Model
Hooks are trusted code that must be:
- Reviewed before deployment
- Sourced from trusted locations
- Validated for malicious behavior
- Regularly audited for security issues

## Performance Implications

### Synchronous Impact
Since hooks run synchronously:
- Fast hooks (< 100ms) are barely noticeable
- Medium hooks (100ms-1s) may cause perceived delays
- Slow hooks (> 1s) significantly impact user experience

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Early Exit**: Check simple conditions first
2. **Caching**: Store expensive computation results
3. **Incremental Processing**: Only check changed files
4. **Async Logging**: Use fire-and-forget logging

## Configuration Philosophy

### Layered Configuration
The multi-file configuration system reflects different concerns:

1. **Global Settings** (`~/.claude/settings.json`): Personal defaults
2. **Project Settings** (`.claude/settings.json`): Team standards
3. **Local Settings** (`.claude/settings.local.json`): Personal overrides

This separation allows for:
- Team consistency through shared project settings
- Personal customization through local settings
- Security through global enforcement policies

### Inheritance Model
Settings merge rather than replace, allowing:
- Additive hook configurations
- Layered permission systems
- Gradual capability enhancement

## Error Handling Philosophy

### Graceful Degradation
Hooks should fail gracefully:
```python
try:
    critical_check()
except Exception as e:
    # Log error but don't break workflow
    print(f"Warning: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(0)  # Continue despite hook failure
```

### Clear Communication
Error messages should be:
- Specific about what failed
- Actionable (tell Claude how to fix)
- Formatted for both human and LLM understanding

## Future Evolution

### Why This Design Scales
The hook system is designed for evolution:

1. **Event Extensibility**: New events can be added without breaking existing hooks
2. **Hook Type Flexibility**: Currently supports commands, could support other types
3. **Configuration Growth**: Settings can be extended with new fields
4. **Tool Integration**: New tools automatically work with existing hook patterns

### Potential Enhancements
- Asynchronous hook execution for non-blocking operations
- Hook dependencies and ordering constraints
- Conditional hook execution based on project state
- Hook marketplaces for sharing common patterns

## Best Practices Rationale

### Keep Hooks Fast
Fast execution preserves the interactive nature of Claude Code, maintaining the conversational flow that makes it effective.

### Use Exit Code 2 Judiciously
Exit code 2 creates a feedback loop where Claude learns from hook guidance, improving code quality over time.

### Provide Clear Feedback
Clear error messages help Claude understand what went wrong and how to fix it, enabling self-correction.

### Handle Errors Gracefully
Graceful error handling ensures that hook failures don't break the development workflow.

The hook system embodies the principle of "automate the routine, enhance the creative" - handling mundane quality control tasks automatically while preserving the creative and problem-solving aspects of development for the human developer and Claude working together.
