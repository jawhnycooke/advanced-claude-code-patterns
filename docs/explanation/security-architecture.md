# Claude Code Security Architecture

Understanding the security model, threat landscape, and architectural decisions behind Claude Code's security framework.

## Security Design Philosophy

Claude Code's security architecture is built on three core principles that guide all security decisions and implementations.

### Defense in Depth

Rather than relying on a single security control, Claude Code implements multiple layers of protection:

- **Perimeter Security**: Permission boundaries and access controls
- **Runtime Security**: Dynamic monitoring and threat detection
- **Data Security**: Encryption, secrets management, and data protection
- **Application Security**: Code analysis, vulnerability scanning, and secure coding practices

This layered approach ensures that if one security control fails, others remain in place to protect the system.

### Principle of Least Privilege

Every component, user, and process receives the minimum permissions necessary to perform its function:

- **Default Deny**: All access is denied by default unless explicitly permitted
- **Granular Permissions**: Fine-grained control over specific operations
- **Time-Limited Access**: Permissions expire and require renewal
- **Context-Aware**: Access decisions consider user, location, time, and resource

### Zero Trust Architecture

Claude Code assumes no implicit trust based on network location or user identity:

- **Verify Everything**: All requests are authenticated and authorized
- **Encrypt All Communications**: Data in transit is always encrypted
- **Monitor and Log**: All activities are logged and monitored
- **Continuous Validation**: Security posture is continuously assessed

## Security Architecture Overview

The security architecture consists of several interconnected components that work together to provide comprehensive protection.

## Security Boundaries

Clear security boundaries help contain threats and limit the impact of successful attacks.

### Process Isolation

Each Claude Code component runs in its own security context:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Host Operating System                                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ┌─────────────┐ ┌─────────────┐ ┌─────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ Claude CLI  │ │ Agent Engine│ │ MCP Server Container   │ │
│ │ Process     │ │ Process     │ │                         │ │
│ │             │ │             │ │ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ │ │
│ │ Limited FS  │ │ Project FS  │ │ │ Server A│ │ Server B│ │ │
│ │ No Network  │ │ HTTP Client │ │ │ Sandbox │ │ Sandbox │ │ │
│ │ User Mode   │ │ User Mode   │ │ └─────────┘ └─────────┘ │ │
│ └─────────────┘ └─────────────┘ └─────────────────────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Network Segmentation

Network access is controlled through multiple layers:

- **Application Layer**: URL allowlists and request filtering
- **Transport Layer**: TLS encryption and certificate validation
- **Network Layer**: Firewall rules and traffic monitoring
- **Physical Layer**: Network access control and segmentation

### Data Classification

Different types of data receive appropriate protection levels:

| Classification | Examples | Protection Measures |
|----------------|----------|-------------------|
| Public | Documentation, open source code | Standard access controls |
| Internal | Business logic, configurations | Access logging, encryption at rest |
| Confidential | Customer data, financial info | Strong encryption, audit trails |
| Restricted | Secrets, keys, personal data | Hardware security modules, strict access |

## Cryptographic Architecture

Cryptography provides the foundation for data protection and secure communications.

### Encryption Standards

#### Data at Rest
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM
- **Key Management**: Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)
- **Key Rotation**: Automatic 90-day rotation
- **Compliance**: FIPS 140-2 Level 3

#### Data in Transit
- **Protocol**: TLS 1.3
- **Cipher Suites**: AEAD ciphers only
- **Certificate Validation**: Full chain validation with pinning
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Mandatory for all connections

#### Digital Signatures
- **Algorithm**: Ed25519 for signing, RSA-PSS for compatibility
- **Verification**: All software updates and configurations
- **Chain of Trust**: Multi-level signing hierarchy
- **Revocation**: Real-time certificate status checking

### Key Management

    KMS[Key Management Service]
    App[Application Keys]
    User[User Keys]

        Root --> Master
        Master --> Data
        Data --> Session
    end
    
    HSM --> Root
```

#### Key Hierarchy
1. **Root Keys**: Stored in HSMs, rarely accessed
2. **Master Keys**: Derived from root keys, encrypt other keys
3. **Data Keys**: Encrypt specific data categories
4. **Session Keys**: Temporary keys for specific sessions

#### Key Lifecycle
- **Generation**: Cryptographically secure random generation
- **Distribution**: Secure channels with mutual authentication
- **Storage**: Hardware-backed secure storage
- **Rotation**: Automated based on time and usage
- **Revocation**: Immediate revocation with blocklists
- **Destruction**: Secure deletion with verification

## Access Control Architecture

Access control ensures that only authorized entities can perform specific operations.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Users are assigned roles that define their permissions:

```
Users → Roles → Permissions → Resources
```

#### Standard Roles

| Role | Permissions | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `Developer` | Read/write code, run tools | Daily development |
| `Reviewer` | Read code, approve changes | Code review |
| `Admin` | Manage permissions, configure | System administration |
| `Auditor` | Read logs, generate reports | Security auditing |
| `Service` | Automated operations | CI/CD systems |

#### Permission Model

Permissions follow the format: `action:resource:condition`

Examples:
- `read:file:project_directory`
- `execute:bash:safe_commands`
- `create:agent:with_approval`
- `access:network:allowlisted_domains`

### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

For fine-grained control, ABAC considers multiple attributes:

- **Subject Attributes**: User identity, role, clearance level
- **Resource Attributes**: Classification, owner, sensitivity
- **Environment Attributes**: Time, location, network, device
- **Action Attributes**: Operation type, risk level, urgency

#### Policy Examples

```json
{
  "policy": "high_risk_operations",
  "condition": {
    "and": [
      {"subject.role": "developer"},
      {"resource.classification": "confidential"},
      {"action.risk": "high"},
      {"environment.time": "business_hours"}
    ]
  },
  "effect": "permit",
  "obligations": ["require_approval", "audit_log"]
}
```

### Dynamic Access Control

Access decisions adapt to changing conditions:

- **Risk-Based**: Higher risk operations require additional verification
- **Context-Aware**: Decisions consider current threat level
- **Adaptive**: Policies adjust based on user behavior patterns
- **Just-in-Time**: Permissions granted for specific time windows

## Monitoring and Detection

Continuous monitoring enables rapid threat detection and response.

### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
