## Product Requirements (from product.md)

### Background
Claude Code represents a revolutionary approach to AI-assisted development, enabling developers to delegate complex coding tasks directly from their terminal. While basic Claude Code usage is documented, advanced workflow optimization and enterprise deployment scenarios remain challenging areas where developers need comprehensive guidance.

### Our Task
Create a comprehensive documentation package featuring practical, production-ready implementations of custom Claude Code agents, hooks, workflows, and templates. This package will include working code examples that developers can immediately adopt.

### Key Deliverables Required

#### Documentation Package Requirements
Your documentation package should include two parts:
1. A comprehensive documentation guide that covers the advanced concepts, implementation patterns, and best practices
2. A working technical implementation (code samples, configuration files, or reference implementation) that demonstrates these concepts in action

#### Specific Requirements:
- **Custom Agent Library**: 6+ production-ready agents with model optimization (sonnet/opus selection)
- **Hook Configuration Patterns**: 5+ advanced hook templates for quality gates and automation
- **Workflow Orchestration**: 5+ complete workflow examples (feature development, incident response, etc.)
- **Slash Command Templates**: 6+ custom commands for common developer tasks
- **MCP Integration Examples**: 5+ external tool integrations (GitHub, databases, monitoring)
- **CLAUDE.md Templates**: 5+ project-specific configuration templates
- **Model Selection Guide**: Best practices for choosing between sonnet (default) and opus models
- **Implementation Guides**: Step-by-step tutorials with working code
- **Best Practices**: Context management, prompting strategies, and optimization techniques
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and resolution approaches
- **Measurement Strategies**: How to evaluate effectiveness and optimize workflows

#### Real-World Use Cases to Cover:
- Security review and compliance automation
- Performance optimization workflows
- Test generation and quality assurance
- Incident response and debugging
- Documentation generation and maintenance
- CI/CD orchestration with safety checks
